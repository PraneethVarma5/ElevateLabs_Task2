# Task-2
# Data Visualization and Storytelling Task

This repository contains the files for the Data Visualization and Storytelling task.

## Task Description

The objective of this task was to create compelling data visualizations to tell a story using a dataset.

Tools used: Power BI

## Dataset

I used the "Sales and Marketing" dataset from Kaggle
This dataset includes information on sales transactions, marketing campaigns, and potentially product and customer details, enabling analysis of sales performance and marketing effectiveness.

## Deliverables

The primary deliverable is a Power BI dashboard visualizing key sales and marketing metrics.

* **Power BI Dashboard:** The dashboard provides an overview of sales performance, marketing campaign effectiveness, and product insights.

    * It includes visualizations such as:
        * Sales Revenue over Time (Line Chart)
        * Sales Revenue by Marketing Campaign (Bar Chart)
        * Marketing Spend by Campaign (Bar Chart)
        * Relationship between Marketing Spend and Sales (Scatter Plot)
        * Sales Revenue by Product Category (Bar Chart)
        * Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like Total Sales, Marketing Spend, and ROI.

## Key Insights

The dashboard is designed to provide insights into the following:

* Overall sales trends and performance.
* The effectiveness of different marketing campaigns in generating sales.
* Sales performance of various product categories.
* The return on investment (ROI) of marketing efforts.

## Approach

The following principles were followed in designing the dashboard, as suggested in the task guidelines: [cite: 2]

* **Right Chart Selection:** Appropriate chart types were chosen to represent the data effectively.
* **Clutter Reduction:** The dashboard was designed to minimize clutter and maximize clarity.
* **Color Usage:** A consistent and restrained color palette was used.
* **Key Takeaways:** The dashboard highlights key metrics and insights.
* **Contextual Information:** Charts are labeled and provide context to the data.
* **Business Focus:** The analysis focuses on providing business insights rather than just displaying data.
